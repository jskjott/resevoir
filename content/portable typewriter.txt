I was frustrated with how current publishing processes force you to spend hours alone on the computer making layouts. 

Inspiration by Robert Ochshorn's wonderful [desert journalism](https://lowerquality.com/desertjournalism/) project I wanted to respond to these frustrations by making printing available in spaces where it currently isnâ€™t and by doing that move away from the extensive and bulky infrastructure which is typically needed to create a printed page.

This was a personal project. To fulfil my vision, I decided to make a portable, battery-operated receipt printer typewriter.

I acquired all the necessary components (Arduino, battery, receipt printer, keyboard) and wrote the Arduino code needed for the different parts to interface with each other. I then went out to test the functioning prototype. It quickly became clear that the small portable typewriter and access to immediate printing enables a lot of activities which traditional publishing does.

Doing this project resulted in deeper appreciation of printing as a medium - in many ways it became a [[pointers]] towards a new media which could spring fourth from further exploring printing and portability.
