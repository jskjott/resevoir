Things and objects appear in peoples life in many different ways. Some are forced upon us as inheritance or gifts. Others are chosen to be actively let in because of interest or necessity. Most exist in a space in-between, their existence a function of our context and behaviour.

No matter the way in which an object has entered our life, they are sure to be part of a grand spectacle wherein not just you yourself build a relationship with the object, but so too does every person who touches it or gets to know about it. Over time an object becomes enmeshed in a great forest of associations, memories, and social judgements of varying nature. A friend visiting you might appreciate an object because of any number of reasons. "that vaseâ€˜s color compliments your eyes", "Oh my dad used to read bedtime stories to me in the light of one of those lamps", "Oh look at that plate, my aunt collects those". These examples point to the sheer variety of ways in which object speak to and activate parts of ourselves.
