## A Webring for the Recurse Center

[github](https://github.com/jskjott/webring)

While at Recurse Center I noticed that many of us value presenting ourselves online in a way which feels authentic and that we like sharing and connecting with others through shared interests.

As a response to this realization I made [a webring](https://webring.recurse.com) to encourage recursers to create an online home and to share traffic amongst each other.

A webring is a collection of websites traditionally linked together by a circular structure. I thought that perhaps this structure would offer a fine way for us to link our online homes together.
