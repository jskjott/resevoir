- The used is more valuable than the new
- The lives of things as they are entangled with the capitalist world
- The periphery of the capitalist world
- Going against the notion and narrative of the new
- Scale, locality, cultural change, economic resilience
- Addiction to unsustainability
- The spectacle of the second hand lottery wheel

Paradigms engaged with by the book
