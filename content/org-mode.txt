Org-mode is a powerful environment for working with ideas, and for organising your projects.

When I heard of it I became incredibly excited and luckily there were many people who were willing to teach me a bit about how to use emacs and org-mode.

After two days of learning and exploration I am starting to organise my life with org-mode. At the moment I mostly use the standard formatting together with the agenda and the capture interface.
