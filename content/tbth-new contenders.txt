What happens when a new object appears as a contender in your life? 

Well I would say it depends on how that object entered your life. A towel gifted to your by your aunt because she knows you love her knitted peach coloured tea towels is very different from a towel which came from a package of 20 synthetic fibre towels which posed to you in the grocery store that afternoon when guests where arriving and there were no objects ready to clean the flat with you. A towel born through loving familier touch is a very different being to one born by the spindling metal fingers of an industrial loom.

So one might re-formulate the question to ask: what has already happened once an object enters your life. This, in many way, is the more important question.
