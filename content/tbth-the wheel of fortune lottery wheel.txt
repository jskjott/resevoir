The Wheel of Fortune

Going to The Dump or local second hand store feels like spinning the wheel of fortune. I go to spin this wheel not to win a monetary prize, but to feel the rush of not knowing what I will encounter. In the last week I learnt about the existence of fake clay pots, e-cigarette chargers, and one hundred year old geography syllabi. I will never get an e-cigarette charger from the second hand store, yet I am sort of in love with the fact that I spent several minutes discussing how to use this funny-looking electrical contraption with a fellow visitor.

As I spin the wheel I get exposed to seeds and grains of local and global history, local and global exchange. The Dump becomes a lens through which I observe the world. Hand-stitched wall decorations featuring pixel-looking portraits of favourite pets long-passed rub up against age-old porcelain whose style and technology was taken to europe by Portuguese ships from China centuries ago.

The fashions of yesteryear are firmly chiseled into the spectacle of the disposed.
