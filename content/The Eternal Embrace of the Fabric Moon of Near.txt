The Eternal Embrace at the Fabric Moon of Near

The moon of Near used to be in co-occurent intersymmetric orbit with its one hundred and thirty two moon brethren. The moon slumbered in this trajectal cradle until one day a distress signal gone astray tore through the expanse and lured Near away from the others. The sorrow of Nears separation was great and it grew mountains as skin to never again heed the ails of others. 

One day the moon of Near came to its senses to the shrill cry of tearing metal. A darkened hull shredded by the very cliff peaks it itself had grown had left clusters of beings shattered across Near's skin. Jumping and floating around in their hermetic suits they crawled all over Near's out- and insides.

Fearful of the moon's skin which had both destroyed and saved them, the children of Near clung to the rock and each other in the center cave located precisely in the center of the tiny moon. And the moon clung to them.

Near was then clad in fabric. Sown together from the shedded spacesuit skin of Near's new inhabitants. Windows were added made from blown crystal  helmet glass. Thermal padding merged with rock, joined together with fine stitches of respindled ventilation garment.

The children and the moon of Near found warmth again.
