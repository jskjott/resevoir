## What is now

A place containing a summery of the current locus of Jonaâ€˜s practice. Big and small, this is a space for the ideas which keep lurking around in the mind, the things touched by the hand.

The top ideas of my mind:

Scale
When to be big, when to be small. Growing up I was often implicitly told that bigger is better, now I believe that is rarely the case.

Visual representations of ecologies in digital environments
In a world of climate crisis it is of vital importance to envision new ways of visually representing the networks of life that surround us.
