A place containing a summery of the current locus of Jonaâ€˜s practice. Big and small, this is a space for the ideas which keep lurking around in the mind, the things touched by the hand.

## The top ideas of my mind:

Scale
- When to be big, when to be small. Growing up I was often implicitly told that bigger is better, now I believe scale is much more complex than that.

The visual representations of ecologies in digital environments
- In a world of climate crisis it is of vital importance to envision new ways of visually representing the networks of life that surround us.

Computers and culture, gods, rituals
- Computers as an entity deeply embedded in culture and practice. How should this realisation influence how we live with computation?
