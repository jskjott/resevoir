All vehicles are ways of seeing. Every vehicle, through the way it exists in relationship to the bodies whose existence it extends, powerfully acts on their userâ€™s worlds. They make some worlds accessible and others inaccessible, and enable the noticing of certain things while hiding others, thereby becoming a texture or aesthetic of experience.

What gaze does a sailboat allow us to cast upon different worlds? This is a question I am only just starting to explore by sailing in dinghies on the river Thames. When in the dinghy, I see buildings through experiencing how they act on the the wind. Being in the presence of other entities on the river - The dinghy folds and twists its sail to maneuvre through the steady stream of fossil pushed crafts.
