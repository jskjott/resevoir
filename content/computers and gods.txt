> In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it.
<cite>Jorge Luis Borges - *On Exactitude in Science*</cite>

Sometimes I close my eyes in an attempt to comprehend what computers are. I think of how they are made from materials dug up from below in places all over the world before they are brought together processed synthesised into something which can carry currents and with them perhaps the world.

I try and think of the networks of cables suspended above sea floors — linking continents and enabling networking at uncomprehendable speeds.

But most of all I think of the computer as a complex compound of culture, power, and history. A radical technology which, like many other technologies before it, remade humans understandings of each other and the world in which they find themselves.

There are many cathedrals in existence.

## What is the nature of the universes which rise out of the digital?

It feels obscene to think of computer programmers as creators of new universes. Yet, what is it that programmers are creating?

> I always imagine that each man-made object is surrounded by a ‘Magical Circle’, just like those radiant Circles in Japanese Magical girl anime. Imagine a stool silently unfolds its ‘Magical Circle’, urging people nearby to sit in it.

> KamiOS is different. It is based in pagan animism, where there are many thousands of gods, who live in everything
